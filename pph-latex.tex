\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    The goal of this report is to provide a comprehensive
    overview of the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)
    on education, exploring the benefits, challenges, and
    future implications of integrating AI technologies into
    learning and teaching processes. The report aims to cover
    various aspects, from personalized learning and
    accessibility to the evolving roles of teachers and the
    development of creativity and critical thinking skills
    in the AI era.
