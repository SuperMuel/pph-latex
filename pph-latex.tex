\subsection{Defining Artificial Intelligence}

\subsubsection{Challenges of defining AI}


Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a buzzword in recent years, with its
applications spanning across various domains, including education. However,
defining AI is not a straightforward task due to several challenges. Firstly,
there is a lack of a universally accepted definition of AI across different
fields and contexts(https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f18cf33eb6e22b1fd665bd24ddf1e9c0509a420)(https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/147fde8bd3c092aeb9372c85cedb460d9f22a2ee).
The concept of AI is complex and multifaceted, making it challenging to arrive
at a precise, all-encompassing definition. Secondly, the rapidly evolving
nature of AI technologies makes it difficult to establish a fixed
definition(https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6624236a5ab39d57d2463fca646e15973a5a6a55)
(https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/147fde8bd3c092aeb9372c85cedb460d9f22a2ee).
As AI capabilities expand, any definition may quickly become outdated.
% TODO : Similarly, when Apple's Siri virtual assistant was first introduced in 2011, it was seen as a groundbreaking AI technology. But today with the advancements of technologies such as chatgpt, it is seen as outdated. 
For instance, a simple linear regression, which is a statistical method used
to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more
independent variables, would be considered as AI by some, while others
would argue that it is just statistics. However, one could argue that all
artificial intelligence techniques are essentially based on statistics.
Even the latest revolutionary AIs work by "predicting the next word" based
on patterns in large datasets. Lastly, various fields, such as computer
science, philosophy, and law, approach AI from different perspectives and
with different goals in mind, leading to a range of definitions that may
not always align(https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d45e5a95b3442afd3028e87edd060fcbacd128dc)
(https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1c7a9ef833287615fae3324eae044fc76839460).

\subsubsection{Common definitions}

Despite the challenges in defining AI, there are some common definitions
that are widely used. For example, Wikipedia defines AI as "intelligence
demonstrated by machines", as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed
by animals including humans. Similarly, the Oxford English Dictionary
defines AI as "The capacity of computers or other machines to exhibit or
simulate intelligent behaviour." However, these definitions are themselves
based on the concept of intelligence, which is also not a trivial task to
define.

Interestingly, what is hard for humans is often easy for computers, and vice
versa. For instance, it is hard for us to make complex computations quickly,
but simple for computers. On the other hand, it is trivial for us to recognize
animals, stop signs, talk, and drive, but these tasks are incredibly
challenging for computers to perform accurately and consistently. In practice,
what is considered as artificial intelligence is often what has been
challenging or seen as impossible for computers in the past. As computers
become more capable of performing tasks that were once thought to be the
exclusive domain of human intelligence, the definition of AI continues
to evolve and expand.

\subsection{Fields of AI}

    %TODO : include source (https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence-tutorial/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning)
\end{figure}



The Artificial Intelligence landscape is vast and encompasses a wide range
of subfields and techniques. Nearly all the recent breakthroughs in AI
can be attributed to the subfield called Machine Learning.

\subsubsection{Introduction of Machine learning (ML)}

Machine Learning (ML) is a special type of AI programming that allows
computers to learn from data, rather than being explicitly programmed
with rules. To illustrate this concept, let's consider the task of
distinguishing between pictures of cats and dogs. It would be incredibly
difficult, if not impossible, to write down all the rules that would
account for all the possible variations in size, color, shape, and
behavior.

This is where Machine Learning comes in. Instead of trying to write down
all these rules, we can provide the computer with a large collection of
labeled pictures (i.e., pictures that have been identified as either a cat
or a dog). The computer then uses statistical techniques to find patterns
and relationships within these pictures. For example, it might learn that
dogs usually have longer noses than cats, or that cats have pointy ears
while dogs' ears are more rounded.

Once the computer has learned these patterns, it can then use them
to correctly identify cats and dogs in new pictures that it hasn't
seen before. In essence, Machine Learning is like giving the computer
a set of examples to learn from, rather than a set of rules to follow.
This makes it a powerful tool for solving complex problems that would
be too difficult for traditional programming. And the best part is,
the more data the computer has to learn from, the better it becomes
at making accurate predictions.

Machine Learning has a wide range of applications across various
domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language
processing (NLP), recommendation systems, fraud detection, predictive
maintenance, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and many more.

\subsubsection{Deep Learning}

Nearly all the recent breakthroughs in Machine Learning can be attributed
to the field of Deep Learning. Deep Learning uses layers of artificial
"neurons" in a way that is similar to how the human brain learns.
This approach is very flexible but requires a lot of data and computer
power.

Thanks to Deep Learning, computers are now able to perform tasks that
were previously thought to be too difficult for them, such as recognizing
speech or understanding natural language. Deep Learning has revolutionized
the field of AI and has opened up new possibilities for solving complex
problems.

\subsection{The technologies we will focus on in this report}

We will not focus on AIs able to distinguish between cats and dogs, or systems that predict the price of Bitcoin. Instead, we will focus on AI technologies that can "understand" and produce human language, and allow engaging conversations between computers and humans.

\subsubsection{Natural Language Processing (NLP)}

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield
of computer science and information retrieval concerned with giving
computers the ability to understand, interpret, and manipulate human
language . The goal is a computer capable of "understanding"
the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the
language within them.

Up until the 1980s, most NLP systems were based on complex sets of
hand-written rules. In the late 1980s, there was a revolution in NLP with
the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing,
due to increasing computational power. In the 2010s, representation learning
and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in
NLP, due to their achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language
tasks.

The development of large pre-trained language models using neural networks and
vast amounts of text data has led to significant advancements in
NLP capabilities in recent years.

\subsubsection{Large Language Models (LLM)}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on massive
amounts of text data to understand and generate human language. They can
perform a wide range of NLP tasks without requiring task-specific training data.
There are a large number of LLMs available, both open-source and closed-source.
Open-source models like Llama (developed by Meta), the "Mistral" models
developed by the French company Mistral, and many more are available to
researchers, companies, and the community. Closed-source models are
developed by companies like OpenAI (GPT-3, GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude),
and Google (Gemini).
LLMs range in size from millions to hundreds of billions of parameters.
Larger models generally have better performance but require more computational
resources. State-of-the-art LLMs exhibit impressive language understanding
and generation capabilities across many benchmarks and real-world
applications. However, LLMs have a limited context window, typically
a few pages of text, limiting their ability to process very long documents
or maintain long-term memory.
LLMs have various applications, such as chatbots and conversational AI
(like ChatGPT) that engage in open-ended dialogue, text generation,
summarization, translation, creative writing assistance, knowledge
retrieval, and question answering from large knowledge bases.
However, LLMs have some limitations in the education context. Training
and running large LLMs is hugely energy-intensive, raising environmental
concerns. Smaller models are more efficient and can even run on phones.
LLMs excel at pattern matching and information retrieval but struggle
with tasks requiring logical reasoning, causal understanding, and domain
expertise. They can also generate plausible but factually incorrect
statements (known as "hallucinations"), which is problematic for
educational applications where accuracy is critical.

\subsubsection{Vision}

More and more LLMs come with vision capabilities, allowing them to handle not just text but also images and even videos. LLMs can perform general-purpose vision tasks such as answering questions about image content, recognizing objects, scenes, and visual concepts, generating detailed, contextual captions and descriptions for images, visual grounding and reasoning (e.g., locating objects mentioned in a query), providing visual explanations and differentiating between similar images/classes, and enabling open-ended visual task instructions via natural language.

Some examples of vision-capable models include GPT-4 (OpenAI), the Claude 3 family of models (Anthropic), and Grok 1.5 Vision (xAI).

\subsubsection{Speech Recognition and Synthesis}

Speech recognition involves converting spoken language into written text. Previous models were not well-suited for human conversation, requiring exaggerated voice clarity and only recognizing one language at a time. Whisper, an open-source speech recognition model by OpenAI, significantly improved performance, understanding technical vocabulary and multiple languages in one conversation.

Speech synthesis has also advanced, with new models capable of simulating emotions and allowing interruptions, enabling more natural human-like conversations.

Combining speech recognition, NLP, and speech synthesis enables real-life conversations with AI, which are faster and more engaging than typing. Example applications include PI.ai, which helps users better understand their emotions without simulating affection, reducing the risk of emotional dependence (although the AI may sometimes be overly supportive), and ChatGPT voice, which allows fluid conversations, such as practicing job interviews with the AI simulating an employer role.

However, the current process of converting voice to text, processing, and converting back to voice removes emotional nuances like irony, humor, and doubt. State-of-the-art solutions are being developed to address this issue.

\subsubsection{Building on LLMs} %TODO : add examples, and clarify the RAG

Beyond chatbots in web browsers, LLMs can be integrated into a wide range of tasks. LLMs are steerable and can act as teachers, experts, or take on various roles. They enable automation and integration with other systems and workflows. For instance, LLMs can be integrated into customer service, and other examples are yet to be explored.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines LLMs with external knowledge retrieval to enhance their factual accuracy and knowledge coverage.

\section{The Growing Influence of AI in Education}
\subsection{Record-Breaking User Growth}
ChatGPT achieved unprecedented user growth, becoming the fastest-growing consumer application in history \cite{https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-in-history-report-says/}. It surpassed 1 million users within just 5 days of launch and skyrocketed to 100 million monthly active users by January 2023, only two months after its debut \cite{https://meetanshi.com/blog/chatgpt-statistics/} \cite{https://nerdynav.com/chatgpt-statistics/} \cite{https://www.namepepper.com/chatgpt-users}. For comparison, TikTok took 9 months and Instagram about 2.5 years to reach the 100 million user milestone \cite{https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-in-history-report-says/}.
As of August 2023, ChatGPT boasts over 180.5 million users, an 80.5% increase in just 8 months \cite{https://meetanshi.com/blog/chatgpt-statistics/} \cite{https://nerdynav.com/chatgpt-statistics/} \cite{https://www.namepepper.com/chatgpt-users}.
\subsection{Global Reach and Demographics}
ChatGPT has a global presence, with users spanning 161 countries \cite{https://meetanshi.com/blog/chatgpt-statistics/}. However, it remains banned in several nations, including China, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela \cite{https://meetanshi.com/blog/chatgpt-statistics/} \cite{https://nerdynav.com/chatgpt-statistics/}.
The United States accounts for the largest share of users at 46.75%, followed by India at 5.47% \cite{https://nerdynav.com/chatgpt-statistics/}. In terms of demographics, 55.99% of ChatGPT users are male, while 44.01% are female \cite{https://nerdynav.com/chatgpt-statistics/}. But most importantly, the majority of users (62.52%) are young, between the ages of 18 and 34 \cite{https://nerdynav.com/chatgpt-statistics/}.
\subsection{News coverage and public attention}
The impact of AI on education has garnered significant media attention, with numerous articles discussing the potential benefits, risks, and implications for students and teachers \cite{https://www.bbc.com/news/education-67433036} \cite{https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2024/02/22/artificial-intelligence-education-return-once-feared-calculator-or-new-opportunity/} \cite{https://theweek.com/education/ai-in-schools-machine-learning}. Headlines have highlighted both the revolutionary potential of AI to transform learning and the challenges it poses for academic honesty and traditional educational practices. The topic has sparked widespread public debate about the appropriate role and regulation of AI tools in schools \cite{https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2024/02/22/artificial-intelligence-education-return-once-feared-calculator-or-new-opportunity/} \cite{https://theweek.com/education/ai-in-schools-machine-learning}.
\subsection{Fear of Widespread Cheating and Plagiarism}
One of the primary concerns surrounding ChatGPT's launch was its potential to facilitate cheating and plagiarism among students \cite{https://oai.missouri.edu/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-and-academic-integrity/} \cite{https://informationmatters.org/2023/02/chatgpt-and-academic-integrity/} \cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/123m3xr/cmv_using_chatgpt_for_academic_purposes_is_not_an/}. With its ability to generate high-quality, human-like text based on prompts, educators feared that students would use ChatGPT to complete assignments, essays, and exams without putting in the necessary effort or learning \cite{https://oai.missouri.edu/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-and-academic-integrity/} \cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/123m3xr/cmv_using_chatgpt_for_academic_purposes_is_not_an/}.
A recent survey revealed that nearly half of students were likely to use AI tools like ChatGPT, while 60% perceived reliance on such tools as cheating \cite{https://oai.missouri.edu/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-and-academic-integrity/}. The ease of use and accessibility of ChatGPT heightened concerns about the prevalence of academic dishonesty across all levels of education \cite{https://informationmatters.org/2023/02/chatgpt-and-academic-integrity/} \cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/123m3xr/cmv_using_chatgpt_for_academic_purposes_is_not_an/}.

Most cheating statistics are derived from surveys in which students are asked about their recent cheating behavior. However, to accurately interpret these statistics, it is crucial to understand what students consider to be cheating. A Pew Research Center survey of U.S. teens, conducted between September 26 and October 23, 2023, revealed an interesting discrepancy in students' perceptions of AI usage. While approximately 60% of students believe that using ChatGPT to write essays is unacceptable, around 70% consider it acceptable to use the tool for researching new topics. This finding suggests that students are more likely to view AI as an acceptable tool for exploration and learning rather than for completing actual assignments or assessments.

% \end{figure}

\subsection{Bans and Restrictions in Schools}
In response to the potential for widespread cheating, several large public school districts, including New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Baltimore, swiftly banned access to ChatGPT on school devices and networks \cite{https://oai.missouri.edu/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-and-academic-integrity/} \cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/123m3xr/cmv_using_chatgpt_for_academic_purposes_is_not_an/}. These bans aimed to prevent students from misusing the tool and to uphold academic integrity standards \cite{https://oai.missouri.edu/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-and-academic-integrity/}.
However, the effectiveness of such bans remains questionable, as students can still access ChatGPT on personal devices outside of school networks \cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/123m3xr/cmv_using_chatgpt_for_academic_purposes_is_not_an/}. The bans also sparked debates about the role of AI in education and the need for schools to adapt to emerging technologies \cite{https://oai.missouri.edu/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-and-academic-integrity/} \cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/123m3xr/cmv_using_chatgpt_for_academic_purposes_is_not_an/}.
Recent research from Stanford University suggests these cheating fears may have been overblown, as overall cheating rates in high schools have not significantly increased despite the growing use of AI tools \cite{https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/technology/chatbot-cheating-schools-students.html}.
\subsection{Emergence of AI Detection Tools}
In response of the cheating concerns, various AI detection tools have been developed to help identify content that has been partially or wholly generated by AI \cite{https://kb.iu.edu/d/bimt}. These tools are intended for use by educators, publishers, recruiters, and others who want to ensure the originality and authenticity of written content. Exemples are Originality.ai \cite{https://originality.ai/}, copyleaks.com \cite{https://copyleaks.com}, quillbot.com \cite{https://quillbot.com/}, gptzero.me \cite{https://gptzero.me/}, or a French tool compilatio.net \cite{https://www.compilatio.net/ia-detecteur-info}. However, the effectiveness and reliability of these tools have been the subject of much debate \cite{https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/how-do-ai-detectors-work/} \cite{https://contadu.com/ai-detection-tools-the-challenge-of-todays-digital-age/} \cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5}.
\subsubsection{How AI Detection Tools Work}
AI detection tools rely on machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify text as either human-written or AI-generated \cite{https://surferseo.com/blog/how-do-ai-content-detectors-work/} \cite{https://contadu.com/ai-detection-tools-the-challenge-of-todays-digital-age/}. They are often built using language models similar to those used in the AI writing tools they aim to detect \cite{https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/how-do-ai-detectors-work/}. These tools work by examining various linguistic patterns, sentence structures, and other characteristics of the text \cite{https://surferseo.com/blog/how-do-ai-content-detectors-work/} \cite{https://contadu.com/ai-detection-tools-the-challenge-of-todays-digital-age/}. They compare the input text to large datasets of known AI-generated and human-written content to determine the likelihood that the text was created by an AI \cite{https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/how-do-ai-detectors-work/} \cite{https://contadu.com/ai-detection-tools-the-challenge-of-todays-digital-age/}. Some common techniques used by AI detection tools include \cite{https://surferseo.com/blog/how-do-ai-content-detectors-work/} \cite{https://contadu.com/ai-detection-tools-the-challenge-of-todays-digital-age/}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perplexity: Measuring how well a language model predicts the next word in a sequence
    \item Burstiness: Analyzing variations in sentence structure and length
    \item Semantic techniques: Topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and consistency assessment
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Challenges and Limitations}
Despite the development of various AI detection tools, their effectiveness and reliability remain questionable \cite{https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/how-do-ai-detectors-work/} \cite{https://contadu.com/ai-detection-tools-the-challenge-of-todays-digital-age/} \cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5}. Several studies have shown that these tools often struggle to accurately classify text, particularly as AI text generators become more advanced \cite{https://contadu.com/ai-detection-tools-the-challenge-of-todays-digital-age/} \cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5}. Some key challenges and limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item High rates of false positives and false negatives \cite{https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/how-do-ai-detectors-work/} \cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5} \cite{https://kb.iu.edu/d/bimt}
    \item Difficulty keeping pace with rapidly evolving AI technologies \cite{https://surferseo.com/blog/how-do-ai-content-detectors-work/} \cite{https://contadu.com/ai-detection-tools-the-challenge-of-todays-digital-age/}
    \item Inconsistent performance across different AI models and generators \cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5}
    \item Reduced effectiveness when faced with obfuscation techniques like manual editing or machine paraphrasing \cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00146-z}
\end{itemize}
Additionally, the results provided by AI detection tools can be difficult for average users to interpret, with some tools providing complex statistical information or highlighting text without clear explanations \cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00146-z}.

\subsubsection{An arm race}
As AI detection tools become more prevalent, users and students are employing various strategies to evade
these tools when using AI-generated content for schoolwork or other purposes. This has led to an ongoing
battle, often referred to as an "arms race," between AI generators and detectors.

Some of the techniques used to bypass AI detection include manual editing and paraphrasing, where users
take the AI-generated text and manually rephrase sentences, change word choices, and introduce minor
grammatical errors to make the writing seem more human-like and less perfect \cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/139wvn7/how_to_avoid_ai_detection/}
\cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/18f0u56/to_fool_an_ai_detector/}.

Another approach is the multilingual method, where users have AI tools like ChatGPT generate the text in a different language,
then translate it back to English themselves, which can help obscure AI patterns
\cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/100jw27/how_you_can_bypass_ai_detection/}.

Users also instruct AI models to mimic specific writing styles, such as a "struggling B-level student"
or a "lazy student rushing to proofread a paper," complete with intentional errors and imperfections
expected from those archetypes \cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/162anql/is_there_any_free_method_to_bypass_ai_detection/}
\cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/18f0u56/to_fool_an_ai_detector/}.

Some even resort to using "AI-detection-bypass" tools, which are AI-powered tools specifically designed
to rephrase AI-generated text in ways that are harder for detectors to identify. Examples of such tools
include Hix AI, Nova, Conch AI, Undetectable AI, and Stealthwriter
\cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/139wvn7/how_to_avoid_ai_detection/}
\cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/162anql/is_there_any_free_method_to_bypass_ai_detection/}
\cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/zmglvv/how_to_outsmart_and_bypass_ai_content_detection/}.

Some users even exploit technical loopholes, such as replacing certain letters in their text with visually
similar Unicode characters, which can trick AI detectors
\cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/122wlot/the_best_way_to_bypass_ai_detectors/}.

Others believe that text from more sophisticated models like GPT-4 is harder for current detectors
to identify compared to GPT-3.5 or other models \cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/100jw27/how_you_can_bypass_ai_detection/}.

However, many users also express doubts about the effectiveness and longevity of these methods.
Students are compiling evidence of false positives from detectors (e.g., flagging historical texts as AI-generated)
to undermine their reliability and persuade schools not to trust the tools \cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/18f0u56/to_fool_an_ai_detector/}
\cite{https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/122wlot/the_best_way_to_bypass_ai_detectors/}.

\subsubsection{Implications and Future Directions}
The development of AI detection tools has significant implications for academia
and beyond. Educators are grappling with how to adapt courses and assessments
to the AI era while maintaining academic integrity
\cite{https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/how-do-ai-detectors-work/}
\cite{https://kb.iu.edu/d/bimt}. Publishers and content creators are
also exploring ways to ensure the originality of their content
\cite{https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/how-do-ai-detectors-work/}.
However, the current limitations of AI detection tools suggest that they
should be used with caution and not relied upon as the sole means of
identifying AI-generated content \cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00146-z}
\cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5}
\cite{https://kb.iu.edu/d/bimt}. Experts emphasize the importance of
combining automated detection with human review and other methods to ensure
the accuracy and fairness of the results \cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00146-z}
\cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5}.
As AI text generators continue to advance, it is clear that AI detection tools will
need to evolve in tandem to remain effective \cite{https://surferseo.com/blog/how-do-ai-content-detectors-work/}
\cite{https://contadu.com/ai-detection-tools-the-challenge-of-todays-digital-age/}
\cite{https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5}.
This ongoing "arms race" between AI generators and detectors is likely to shape
the future of academic integrity and content authenticity in significant ways.
Educators, institutions, and policymakers will need to stay informed about the
latest developments in AI technology and adapt their practices accordingly to
ensure the integrity of the educational process in the face of these rapidly evolving tools.

Governments and international organizations are developing frameworks and guidelines to ensure the safe, ethical, and effective use of AI in education. For example, the Australian Government Department of Education has released the inaugural Australian Framework for Generative Artificial Intelligence in Schools, to be implemented from Term 1 2024 \cite{https://www.educationmattersmag.com.au/federal-government-releases-first-ai-framework-for-schools/}. The framework prioritizes privacy, security, safety, teaching and learning outcomes, human and social wellbeing, transparency, fairness, and accountability \cite{https://www.educationmattersmag.com.au/federal-government-releases-first-ai-framework-for-schools/}.
UNESCO has also developed policy guidance for leveraging AI in education, emphasizing the need to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating risks \cite{https://www.teachingtomorrow.co.uk/news/artificial-intelligence-in-education-empowering-teachers-and-students}. The guidance covers various aspects, including promoting inclusive and equitable use of AI, developing ethical guidelines, fostering local AI innovations, and building an evidence base through pilot testing and evaluation \cite{https://www.teachingtomorrow.co.uk/news/artificial-intelligence-in-education-empowering-teachers-and-students}.
As part of its broader national strategy for artificial intelligence (AI), the French government has recognized the importance of integrating AI into the education system. The strategy aims to position France as a global leader in AI research, development, and innovation, with education playing a crucial role \cite{https://www.economie.gouv.fr/strategie-nationale-intelligence-artificielle} \cite{https://www.entreprises.gouv.fr/fr/numerique/enjeux/la-strategie-nationale-pour-l-ia}. In March 2024, the Commission on Artificial Intelligence submitted a report to the President of the Republic containing 25 recommendations to help France capitalize on the AI technological revolution \cite{https://edunumrech.hypotheses.org/11602} \cite{https://www.ac-paris.fr/l-intelligence-artificielle-dans-l-education-130992} \cite{https://www.campusmatin.com/numerique/equipements-systemes-informations/commission-ia-les-recommandations-pour-l-enseignement-superieur-et-la-recherche.html}. These recommendations were based on extensive consultations and aim to guide public authorities in making decisions to position France at the forefront of AI, including in the field of education.
